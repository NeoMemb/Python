<h1>Some of few things i can do after few weeks of learning Python</h1>
<b><i>Python is fun...</i></b>
<li><ul>Simple_calculator.py is literally asimple calculator. That does basic mathematical calculations</ul>
<ul>gallery.py: i should have save it as image_viewer.py. It does view images by iterating of the array. But it might not run for now due to a big bug (not a parasitic bug though ðŸ˜†). After the bug, i intend to make it work like it's working with a file manager, like an actual gallery, instead of just manually move files name to the code(maybe diresctory name should be better)</ul></li>
